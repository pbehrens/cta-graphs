<h3>Inputting ad Analyzing Data</h3>
<p>One of the most common ways of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-data.html">importing data</a> into R is using a text file that is delimitated with some sort of character. There are also packages that allow you to input data from a database, or other formats. Once the data is imported as a data frame you can start creating models and graphs.</p>

To go through the examples of this post you can download the data files from here.

<h3>Reading CSV Files</h3>
<p>
To read in a CSV file as a data frame use the read.csv() function. This will return a data frame with the data from the file. If there is a header for the file then you can import that as well for the column labels. Otherwise
<code>
# read in data.csv
# head=TRUE imports header values from the csv file and sets them to column names
# set the seperator using the sep argument
> babyData <- read.csv(file="babies.csv", head=TRUE, sep=",")
> colnames(babyData)

# print out the new datas columns
> colnames(babyData)
[1] "birth_weight" "gestation"    "parity"       "age"          "height"      
[6] "weight"       "smoke"

# if you want to change the column labels you can pass the colnames() function a vector of labels
> colnames(babyData) <- c("Birth Weight", "Gestation", "Parity", "Age", "Height", "Weight", "Smoke")
</code>
</p>


<p>
The baby birth data set is pretty large so it's not the best to print out the entire data frame. There are a few functions that R provides that enable you to get a good idea of what the imported data looks like. Use can use head() and tail() to view the first and last 6 rows of the data frame.
<code>
# you can use head() to print out the first 6 entries in the data tail
> head(babyData)

6          136       286      0  25     62     93     0
# tail returns the last 6
> tail(babyData)




# new column names
> head(babyData)
