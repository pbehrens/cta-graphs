This directory contains Python code for communicating with S (i.e. R
and SPlus). 

RS:
 The `RS' module contains Python code that the user calls to communicate 
 with the R engine to invoke functions and methods, get objects, etc. 

RSInternal:
 The module `RSInternal' is C-level code that actually performs these 
 calls. The routines this exports are not intended to be called directly. 

RReference:
 This provides the classes to represent an S object in Python as a
 "foreign reference".
