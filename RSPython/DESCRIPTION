Title: Interface between Python and S language
Description: Allows Python programs to invoke S functions, methods, etc.
     and S code to call Python functionality. This uses a general foreign
     reference mechanism to avoid copying and translating object contents
     and definitions.
Depends: R (>= 1.3.0)
Note: Python 1.5 or higher. This is released by the Omegahat Project for Statistical
      Computing. Bug reports should be submitted via
